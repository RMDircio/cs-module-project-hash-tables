        Q: Average-case?

        A: Let
        n 	= 	Number of keys stored in T
        m 	= 	Number of slots in T
        α 	= 	n/m
        Note:

            α = average number of elements in a chain, or load factor
            α can be less than or greater than 1
            If m is proportional to n (that is, m is chosen as a linear function of n), then n = O(m).
            In that case,

            α = n/m = O(m)/m = O(1)
